This is a personal Touhou fan game made using JavaScript. It is built with the [LittleJS Game Engine](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS). 

The gameplay and artstyle is heavily inspired by [Realm of the Mad God](https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/) (RotMG), a game that I played a lot as a child from around 2012-2015. Further inspiration is taken from Vampire Survivors and Touhou Project.
