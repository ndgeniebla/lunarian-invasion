# Lunarian Invasion
This is a personal Touhou fan game made using JavaScript. It is built with the [LittleJS Game Engine](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS). 

The gameplay and artstyle is heavily inspired by [Realm of the Mad God](https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/) (RotMG), a game that I played a lot as a child from around 2012-2015. Further inspiration is taken from Vampire Survivors and Touhou Project.

## Objective
Survive as many waves as possible and get the highest score.

## Basic Controls
**Movement**: WASD

**Shoot**: Left Click

**Use Special Ability**: Spacebar

**Slow Movement/Focus mode**: Hold Left Shift

**Pause**: ~ (tilde key)

## Credits
Death sound comes from [Touhou Koumakyou](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil) by Team Shanghai Alice.

Characters are of the property of Team Shanghai Alice (though the sprites are created by me).
